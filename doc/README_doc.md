# README for doc subdirectory

The files in this `doc` subdirectory are purely for documentation purposes as discussed [here](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om3/issues/75#issuecomment-1916046691). They do not constitute a working configuration (to get a working configuration you'll need to checkout another branch as explained [here](https://github.com/COSIMA/MOM6-CICE6-WW3/blob/main/README.md)).

The files in here should be the minimum required to support code search from links in the [ACCESS-OM3 wiki](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om3/wiki). They should be kept up to date with a working configuration branch using the script `update_doc.sh`, which also updates the history below.
